# DeepfakeImage
This project focuses on detecting deepfake images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). With the rise of AI-generated content, detecting synthetic and manipulated media has become increasingly important. This repository implements a deep learning approach using CNN architectures to classify images as real or deepfake.
