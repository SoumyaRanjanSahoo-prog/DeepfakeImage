# DeepfakeImage
This project focuses on detecting deepfake images using an hybrid approch that the combined form of traditional model (Fisherface) + Modern CNN model (ResNet50V2).
Here I take a moderate no of image dataset containing 60,000 images.
With the rise of AI-generated content, detecting synthetic and manipulated media has become increasingly important. This repository implements a deep learning approach using CNN architectures to classify images as real or deepfake.
